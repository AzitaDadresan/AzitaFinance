# Financial Models in Python

This repository contains implementations of various financial models using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Each model is designed to simulate key financial processes and visualize their behavior.

## Notebooks

1. **[Binomial Model Pricing](binomial_option_pricing.ipynb)** – A binomial tree model for option pricing.
2. **[Euler-Maruyama Simulation](euler_maruyama.ipynb)** – A numerical method to approximate solutions to stochastic differential equations.
3. **[GBM Monte Carlo Simulation](gbm_montecarlo.ipynb)** – A Monte Carlo approach to simulating Geometric Brownian Motion.
4. **[Vasicek Interest Rate Model](vasicek_simulation.ipynb)** – A stochastic process for modeling interest rates.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-repo-url>
